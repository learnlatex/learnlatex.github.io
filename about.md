The learnlatex.org site is aimed at providing a basic introduction to LaTeX. To
make the material accessible, it is broken down into a series of small lessons.
The demonstration files provided are also hosted on-line to let new users get
started straight away.

The LaTeX ecosystem is rich and complex, and this can be intimidating to new
users. To avoid overload, this site therefore is quite deliberately limited in
scope, covering essential ideas using core LaTeX packages and classes, and
leaving further help to other places.
