## Journal-specific classes

Many academic journals provide LaTeX classes for submissions. These
typically set up the layout to be similar to the final journal,
although that does depend on font usage, etc. If there is a class
available, it is normally provided directly by the editorial office,
who should give appropriate detail on what features it has. Many of
these are also available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org) and in standard TeX
distributions.

## Classes for presentations

One area that needs a lot of special treatment is creating presentations. The `slides`
class was written for making 'classical' printed slides, and it does not
have any special support for on-screen presentations. Two classes
have been developed to do just that, and that are widely used:
`beamer` and `powerdot`. As `beamer` is probably the more common one, we will
give you an example of how it works:

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A first frame}
  Some text
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A second frame}
  Different text
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> First item
    \item<2-> Second item
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{document}
```

This shows two important ideas. First, `beamer` divides a document into frames,
each of which can make more than one slide (page). Second, `beamer` adds to the
normal LaTeX syntax to allow parts of the source to appear 'a bit at a time'.
This is powerful but more complicated than we can cover here: take a look  at
[this blog
entry](https://www.texdev.net/2014/01/17/the-beamer-slide-overlay-concept/) for
more.

## A class for images

There are occasions when you need to make an image (which might be text-heavy)
using LaTeX. Often, you do not want anything other than the content itself on
the 'page'. That is easiest to do using the [`standalone`](https://ctan.org/pkg/standalone)
class. It automatically sets the size of the page to surround the printed content.

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
A simple document: this will be a very small box!
\end{document}
```
