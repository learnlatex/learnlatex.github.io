    <p>LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is <em>not</em> a word processor, 
    and because it is not a single program. Our aim is to help you get 
    started with LaTeX: the basics, installation, writing code, without 
    trying to show you <em>everything</em> in one go. <a href="./mission">More on our mission &hellip;</a></p>
