## Documented sources of {{site.latex}}

The `texdoc` command described earlier is not restricted to package documentation. If you wish to
go beyond the areas covered by this course and study the LaTeX inplementation in detail then
the following links may help.

The source of LaTeX itself is available as a LaTeX-typeset document `source2e.pdf`, available
from `texdoc source2e` or at
[texdoc.net](https://texdoc.net/pkg/source2e)

Current releases of LaTeX also have preloaded the LaTeX3 Programming Language code, previously available
as the `expl3` package.  `texdoc` may be used to see the
[expl3 interface description](http://texdoc.net/pkg/interface3) (`texdoc interface3`)
or
[full expl3 source code](http://texdoc.net/pkg/source3) (`texdoc source3`).
