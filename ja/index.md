      >Introduction</h3>
    <p>LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is <em>not</em> a word processor, 
    and because it is not a single program. Our aim is to help you get 
    started with LaTeX from the basics, installation, to writing code, without 
    trying to show you <em>everything</em> in one go. <a href="./mission">More on our mission &hellip;</a></p>

      >How it works</h3>
      <p>We have taken 16 of the most important things you will need to know, and made them into short <em>lessons</em> which should not take long to cover. In each lesson, we give lots of examples of what you would write. You can edit and run them in this website. <a href="./help#examples">More on examples &hellip;</a></p>

## Going further

We cover getting more information in [the last lesson](./lesson-16), but it is worth saying now that getting access to a book about LaTeX is still the best way to learn the details. We give some recommendations in the last lesson.
