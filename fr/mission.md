# Learn LaTeX Mission

This website aims to help you take the first steps with LaTeX, a document preparation system designed to produce high-quality typeset output. LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is not a word processor, and because it is not a single program. Our aim here is to help you get started without trying to show you everything in one go.
