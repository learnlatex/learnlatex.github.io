The word “LaTeX” actually consists of two components, “La” and “TeX”. In the
following we will briefly describe where they come from.

TeX was originally invented by Stanford professor Donald Knuth. Knuth is
well known for a series of books called “The Art of Computer Programming”
(known as "TAOCP"). In
1973 a new edition of the books was to be made; this was the time when the
typesetting industry switched from traditional typesetting with lead to
photo-based typesetting. Donald Knuth did not like the quality of the print and
therefore decided to implement his own typesetting system.

In May 1977 the development of TeX started.

The original TeX was rather complicated to use, even Donald Knuth used various
macros to edit his books. Leslie Lamport, who works for Microsoft nowadays, also
developed a set of macros that simplify the use of TeX and called this macro
set “LaTeX”.

Today LaTeX is the most common way to interact with TeX. Another alternative is
[ConTeXt](https://www.contextgarden.net/).
