This course has given an overview of the core features of LaTeX.
LaTeX has vast array of extension packages and is used in many subject
areas.  We give here some examples, with no explanation here but links
to the package documentation at [texdoc.net](https://texdoc.net).
The examples are taken from the package documentation unless otherwise noted.

**Note** that inclusion here is not intended as an endorsement of the
  package over other similar packages, we just aim for a small sample
  showing a range of areas not otherwise covered in this course.
